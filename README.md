# plot_with_R

This repository contains the assignment for the week1 to Exploratory Data Analysis.
The goal is to reproduce some plots using R.
The data is a 2 days measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

# plot1.R 
- load the zip data, unzip and then select the usefull data, create a two days file which will be used for the other plots
- plot the histogram of Global Active Power
- produce plot1.png

# plot2.R
- load the 2 days dataset made available in the repo and coming from the plot1.R code
- plot the Global Active Power with date
- produce plot2.png

# plot3.R
- load the 2 days dataset made available in the repo and coming from the plot1.R code
- plot energy sub metring for 1 / 2 / 3 with date
- produce plot3.png


# plot4.R
- load the 2 days dataset made available in the repo and coming from the plot1.R code
- plot a panel of 4 graphics
- produce plot4.png
